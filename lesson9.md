# Tables

* Drawing tables in Markdown is just like drawing
* You dont actually need all those dashes in between the pipe, you need a minimum of **3**
* You can left-aligned, center or right-aligned the text in each table column
    * :--:   this is center
    * ---    no colon is left-aligned
    * ---:   have a colon at the right hand side is right-aligned
